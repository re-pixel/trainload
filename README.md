# Train Load

## How to run

Read the railway graph from standard input and print the cargo analysis result:

```bash
./gradlew run < input.txt
```

Without an input file, the program reads from the terminal (type the input and press Ctrl+D when done).

## How to run tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Test report: `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
